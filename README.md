StarCatcher
============

For Facebook's 2012 Summer of Hack, LuisBosquez and I made StarCatcher, a browser game in which you click the stars before the fall to the ground.

To run the game, simply open starcatchergame.html in your favorite browser (please make your favorite browser Chrome...but any modern browser should do).

We used Kinetic.JS for gravity and such. Everything else was by the magic of our minds. And fingers.

Check out the beautiful CSS3 magic for the artsy fartsy graphics. No images were used.
